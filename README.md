# Asset pricing Model: CAPM vs Fama-French 3 factors Program
Project in Programming with Advanced Computer Languages 2023  
St.Gallen Dec 2022  
Project description:  
Download the Fama-French portfolios and the Fama-French factors from Kenneth Frenchâ€™s home-page. Use the equally weighted portfolios, monthly data for 1960-today. Construct excess returns of the portfolios by subtracting the risk-free rate. Reproduce the figures below (taken from J.H.Cochrane, asset pricing, chapter 20).
  
Run CAPM regressions on the excess returns, where Mkt-RF is taken to be the market excess
return. Plot the results (a scatter plot of predicted against actual average excess returns).
  
Run Fama-French regressions (adding SMB and HML to the CAPM regressions, which already
are excess returns). Plot the results (a scatter plot of predicted against actual average excess
returns.
